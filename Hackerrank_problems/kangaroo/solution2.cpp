// LOGIC:
// First, we compare the first kangaroo's location & rate with the second one.
//      if the first kangaroo's location & rate both are higher than the second or vice versa,
//      there's no way both will reach same location at any point.
// Second, if the location & rate of both the kangaroos are same, 
//      then they will both reach at the same time.
// Third, if both the kangaroos have same location but dofferent rates,
//      then again no chance of reaching together.
// ELSE, we calculate a variable 'y' which can make both their final locations same.
// Then we check if the value of 'y' can satisfy the given location & rate value.
//  If yes, then they reach together
// Else they don't.
